<h1>Why I made it</h1>
<p>Seen this project done plenty of times on python but at the time of creation I couldn't find anyone who had made it in C++ so I did for my simple amusement.</p>

<h1>what it does</h1>
<p>Once compiled and you run the executable, it will connect to the drone feed and give you live feed of the drones camera and will have control over drones basic control features</p>

<h1>Whats to come</h1>
<p>I plan on implementing some hand and face detection features. This will allow me to assign specific events on specific detections.</p><br>
<p2>-body recognition to follow human<br>
    -hand recognition to fly closer,farther,upwards or lower to human who it's following
